## Introduction

In this guide, we build a simple terminal-based code editor that:
- **Accepts keyboard input:** Capturing user keystrokes to update the code content.
- **Displays content dynamically:** Redrawing the screen as the user types.
- **Uses a modular design:** Each piece of functionality is built step-by-step so that each part can be tested independently.

We leverage the `textual` library, which provides:
- **`App` class:** The main entry point for creating a terminal application.
- **`Widget` class:** To create custom UI components.
- **Event handling:** To process keyboard inputs and update the display.

## Step 1: Setting Up a Basic Textual App

### Objective & Explanation

**Goal:** Initialize a basic `textual` application.  
**Thought Process:**  
- Begin with the minimal structure provided by `textual` using the `App` class.
- This step verifies that your environment is properly set up and that you can run a basic terminal app.

### Code Snippet

```python
from textual.app import App

class BasicApp(App):
    async def on_mount(self):
        # Called when the app is ready to run.
        self.log("Basic Textual App has started.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    BasicApp.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion

- **`from textual.app import App`:**  
  Imports the `App` class, the core class to initialize a terminal application.
- **`class BasicApp(App)`:**  
  Inherits from `App` to create a new application.
- **`on_mount` method:**  
  Called when the app is ready; here we simply log a message to verify the app starts.

Run this snippet to ensure your basic application launches successfully.

## Step 2: Creating a Code Editor Widget

### Objective & Explanation

**Goal:** Develop a custom widget to display and hold code content.  
**Thought Process:**  
- Use the `Widget` class from `textual` to create a dedicated component.
- This widget will eventually handle displaying the code and updating when new input is received.

### Code Snippet

```python
from textual.widget import Widget
from rich.text import Text

class CodeEditor(Widget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.content = "Start coding here...\n"

    def render(self):
        # Render the current content using rich's Text
        return Text(self.content)
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion

- **`from textual.widget import Widget`:**  
  Provides a base class to build custom UI components.
- **`self.content`:**  
  A simple string attribute to store the code. Initially populated with a placeholder.
- **`render` method:**  
  Returns a `rich` Text object to display the content. This method is called automatically to redraw the widget.

Test this widget by creating an instance and verifying its output within the application.

## Step 3: Handling Keyboard Input

### Objective & Explanation

**Goal:** Implement keyboard input handling to update the code editor.  
**Thought Process:**  
- Override the `on_key` event in our widget to capture each key pressed.
- Append the new key to the content string and refresh the display.

### Code Snippet

```python
from textual import events

class CodeEditor(Widget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.content = "Start coding here...\n"

    async def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        # Append the key pressed to the content and refresh the widget.
        self.content += event.key
        self.refresh()

    def render(self):
        from rich.text import Text
        return Text(self.content)
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion

- **`from textual import events`:**  
  Imports event types, including keyboard events.
- **`on_key` method:**  
  Captures keyboard input. Here, `event.key` gives the pressed key. The content is updated, and `self.refresh()` triggers a redraw.
- **Event Handling:**  
  This method is asynchronous (using `async def`) to fit into the event loop that `textual` uses.

Test this step by running the editor and typing. Each keystroke should update the displayed content.

## Step 4: Integrating and Finalizing the Editor

### Objective & Explanation

**Goal:** Combine the basic app and the code editor widget into a fully functional terminal-based code editor.  
**Thought Process:**  
- Dock the `CodeEditor` widget within the main app.
- Ensure the widget is responsive and displays input correctly.
- Keep the code minimal while showcasing essential functionality.

### Final Minimal Code

```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widget import Widget
from textual import events
from rich.text import Text

class CodeEditor(Widget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.content = "Start coding here...\n"

    async def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        # Handle keyboard input: add the pressed key to content.
        self.content += event.key
        self.refresh()

    def render(self):
        # Render the content using rich Text.
        return Text(self.content)

class CodeEditorApp(App):
    async def on_mount(self):
        # Create an instance of the CodeEditor widget.
        editor = CodeEditor()
        # Dock the editor widget in the application view.
        await self.view.dock(editor, edge="top")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditorApp.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion

- **`CodeEditorApp` Class:**  
  Inherits from `App` and is the main entry point. The `on_mount` method docks the `CodeEditor` widget into the application.
- **Docking:**  
  The `await self.view.dock(editor, edge="top")` command positions the editor widget. Textual’s docking system allows flexible layouts.
- **Integration:**  
  Combines previous steps—initializing the app, creating a custom widget, and handling keyboard input.

Run this final code to experience a minimal terminal-based code editor that accepts input and displays it.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we built a terminal-based code editor using Python and `textual` by:

- Setting up a basic Textual app.
- Creating a custom widget (`CodeEditor`) to hold and render code.
- Implementing keyboard input handling to update the widget’s content.
- Integrating all parts into a final minimal yet functional code editor.

This guide provides a foundation for further enhancements, such as syntax highlighting, file I/O operations, and more advanced text manipulation features. Happy coding!
