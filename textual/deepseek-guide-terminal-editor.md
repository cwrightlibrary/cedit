# Building a Terminal-Based Code Editor Using Python and `textual`

This guide will walk you through the process of building a minimal terminal-based code editor using Python and the `textual` library. `textual` is a powerful library for building text-based user interfaces (TUIs) in Python. By the end of this guide, you will have a functional, albeit minimal, code editor that runs in the terminal.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

### Objective & Explanation
The first step is to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies. We will use `textual` to create the TUI, so we need to ensure it is installed.

### Code Snippets
```bash
pip install textual
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **`textual`**: This library provides the necessary tools to create a TUI. It includes classes like `App` for managing the application, `Widget` for creating UI components, and `events` for handling user input.

## Step 2: Creating a Basic `textual` Application

### Objective & Explanation
In this step, we will create a basic `textual` application. This will serve as the foundation for our code editor.

### Code Snippets
```python
from textual.app import App

class CodeEditor(App):
    async def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.title = "Code Editor"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditor.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **`App`**: The base class for any `textual` application. It manages the application lifecycle and event loop.
- **`on_mount`**: This method is called when the application is ready to start. We use it to set the title of the application.

## Step 3: Adding a Text Area for Code Input

### Objective & Explanation
Next, we will add a text area where users can input and edit code. We will use the `TextArea` widget from `textual`.

### Code Snippets
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import TextArea

class CodeEditor(App):
    async def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.title = "Code Editor"
        text_area = TextArea()
        await self.view.dock(text_area)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditor.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **`TextArea`**: A widget that allows multi-line text input. It is ideal for a code editor as it supports syntax highlighting and other features.
- **`dock`**: This method is used to add widgets to the application layout. We dock the `TextArea` to the main view.

## Step 4: Handling Keyboard Input

### Objective & Explanation
In this step, we will handle keyboard input to allow basic text editing. We will use `textual`'s event system to capture key presses.

### Code Snippets
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import TextArea
from textual import events

class CodeEditor(App):
    async def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.title = "Code Editor"
        self.text_area = TextArea()
        await self.view.dock(self.text_area)

    async def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        if event.key == "ctrl+q":
            await self.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditor.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **`events.Key`**: This event is triggered whenever a key is pressed. We use it to capture key presses and perform actions.
- **`on_key`**: This method is called whenever a key is pressed. We check if the key combination is `ctrl+q` to quit the application.

## Step 5: Adding Syntax Highlighting

### Objective & Explanation
To make our code editor more useful, we will add basic syntax highlighting. `TextArea` supports syntax highlighting out of the box, so we just need to configure it.

### Code Snippets
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import TextArea
from textual import events

class CodeEditor(App):
    async def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.title = "Code Editor"
        self.text_area = TextArea(language="python")
        await self.view.dock(self.text_area)

    async def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        if event.key == "ctrl+q":
            await self.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditor.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **`language="python"`**: This parameter enables syntax highlighting for Python code. `TextArea` supports multiple languages, and you can specify the language you want to highlight.

## Step 6: Final Minimal Code Editor

### Objective & Explanation
In this final step, we will combine all the pieces into a minimal yet complete terminal-based code editor. The editor will support basic text input, syntax highlighting, and a quit command.

### Code Snippets
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import TextArea
from textual import events

class CodeEditor(App):
    async def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.title = "Code Editor"
        self.text_area = TextArea(language="python")
        await self.view.dock(self.text_area)

    async def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        if event.key == "ctrl+q":
            await self.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    CodeEditor.run()
```

### Detailed Functionality Discussion
- **Final Application**: This is the complete code for our minimal code editor. It includes a `TextArea` for text input, syntax highlighting for Python, and a quit command (`ctrl+q`).
- **Minimalism**: The final solution is minimal but functional. It demonstrates the core functionalities of a code editor, including text input, syntax highlighting, and basic keyboard input handling.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have built a minimal terminal-based code editor using Python and the `textual` library. This guide has walked you through the process step-by-step, explaining the rationale behind each design decision and function usage. You can now extend this editor with additional features, such as file saving/loading, more advanced syntax highlighting, or even a plugin system. Happy coding!
